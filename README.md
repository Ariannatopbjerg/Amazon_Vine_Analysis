# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is designed to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. This program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to recieve reviews for their products. 

In this project, approximately 50 datasets were accessable to choose from and analyze. For this specific analysis, I chose to look at outdoor supplise. I used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. I then used PySpark to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviwes from Vine members in the dataset.
